## REAL AND FRAUDULENT JOB POSTING PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES

Due to Covid-19 Pandemic, Every sector has moved to virtual mode including recruitment for various job postings in public and private sector .This allows everyone to reduce their dependency on manual efforts and since all the job postings are posted online, it gives the recruiting company or agency a wide range of area to gather the talented candidates. People who are seeking for job can also know the information of the recruiting company /sector through the internet. But all job postings which are posted in the internet recruiting sites are not real and there are fraudulent job postings also. So we try to predict the fraudulent posting and real one. so the aim  of this project is to use machine learning based techniques for real or fake job prediction results in best accuracy. Here we  propose a machine learning-based method to accurately predict the fraudulent jobs in the form of whether the job is real or not.
